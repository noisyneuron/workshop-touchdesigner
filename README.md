# TouchDesigner Workshop, ITP Camp 2019

* Interface-parts.pdf has labels for various controls on the nodes and the parameter pane 
* Interface-controls is a small cheat sheet on mouse and keyboard controls (in markdown and pdf)
* Neither of these are complete!
* The files folder will be populated with TouchDesigner files as we build things out
* More notes will be added soon!
